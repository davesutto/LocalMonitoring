# LocalMonitoring
Using Processing and Raspberry Pi to monitor Temperature, Pressure and Light Levels, and estimate Tides

*This is my first Github project. I'm using it to try out Processing on the Raspberry Pi and Pi zero*

I have strated with a combined Clock and Tide predictor for my local town. Again I just used it to try out Processing on Windows. Now porting to the Pi and adding sensors for weather conditions.
